# Netris / Net  Tetris

My first game, a Tetris clone which will eventually go 2-player head-to-head mode over a network.

Goals:
* Portable, should run on anything
* Runs cool - no fast loops

Goals for server-side:
* Low latency and zero GC techniques

Non-goals:
* 

Learning opportunities:
* Get familiar with some game basics
* Show myself I can write something myself before one day using engines
* Explore rendering, hopefully run into problems
